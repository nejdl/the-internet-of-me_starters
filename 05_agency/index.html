    <h1>Agency</h1>
    <p>
      Agency is meant to measure someone’s or something’s <span contenteditable="true">“capacity, condition, or state of acting or of exerting power”</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An action is basically a choice, and agency measures the capacity of making choices. No choice, on the contrary, is behavior. The addict has little agency because their choice to interrupt their toxic behavior exists, but is tremendously difficult. In short, I propose to define agency as the capacity for action, which is in turn the ability to interrupt behavior.<sup>1</sup>
